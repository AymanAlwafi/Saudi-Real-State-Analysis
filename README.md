# Saudi-Real-State-Analysis
Saudi Real Estate AI

A Machine Learning Approach aligned with Saudi Vision 2030

Overview

The Saudi real estate market is undergoing rapid transformation, driven by Vision 2030 and the National Housing Strategy. This project applies data mining and machine learning techniques to classify residential properties into "Affordable" vs. "High-Value" categories.

By analyzing over 5,000 listings from major Saudi cities, we developed a predictive model that helps investors, developers, and policymakers understand the key drivers of property value beyond just location.
